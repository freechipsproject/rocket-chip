/** Diplomacy is a set of abstractions for describing directed, acyclic graphs
  * where parameters will be negotiated between nodes. These abstractions are
  * expressed in the form of abstract classes, traits, and type parameters, which
  * comprises nearly all of the types defined in this package.
  *
  * The [[NodeImp]] ("node implementation") is the main abstract type that associates
  * the type parameters of all other abstract types. Defining a concrete
  * implementation of [[NodeImp]] will therefore determine concrete types for all
  * type parameters. For example, passing in a concrete instance of NodeImp to a
  * SourceNode will fully determine concrete types for all of a SourceNode's type
  * parameters.
  *
  * Specific applications of Diplomacy are expected to either extend these types
  * or to specify concrete types for the type parameters. This allows for
  * creating and associating application-specific node, edge, parameter, and bundle types.
  *
  *
  * =Concepts, metaphors, and mnemonics to help with understanding Diplomacy code=
  *
  * ==Parameter Types==
  *  
  *  There are several types of parameters involved in diplomacy code.
  *  
  *  - Upward-flowing/Downward-flowing Parameters: These parameter types flow along edges and can be considered as the
  *    pre-negotiated, unresolved parameters.
  *  - Edge Parameters: These parameters are the result of the diplomatic negotiation and that is resolved for each edge.
  *    They are metadata, or an abstract concept of the connection represented by their edge, and contain any sort.
  *    These are an abstract concept which carry any sort of conceptual information that is useful to pass along the graph edge.
  *    For example, the full address map visible from a given edge and the supported access types for each memory region.
  *  - "p" Parameters: These are parameters of type [[Parameters]] which are implicit and generally available
  *    in various stages of the diplomacy codebase.
  *    Often they are captured from the context in which a particular diplomatic node or edge is created or bound.
  *  - Bundle Parameters: These parameters are used for actual hardware generation of the [[chisel3.Data]]s which connect
  *    diplomatic components. In contrast to edge parameters, this may carry information like the width of an address
  *    or opcode field.
  *    While they are derived from Edge parameters holding all metadata computed over an edge,
  *    Bundle parameters often contain only concrete information required to create the hardware type,
  *    such as [[freechips.rocketchip.tilelink.TLBundleParameters]] and [[freechips.rocketchip.amba.axi4.AXI4BundleParameters]]
  *  
  * ==Inward/Outward vs. Upward/Downward==
  *
  * Diplomacy defines two dimensions: inward/outward and upward/downward.
  *
  * Inward/outward refer to the direction of edges from the perspective of a given node.
  * For a given node:
  * - Inward refers to edges that point into itself.
  * - Outward refers to edges that point out from itself.
  *  
  * Therefore, a given edge is always described as inward to one node and as outward from another.
  *
  * Upward/downward refer to the direction of the overall directed acyclic graph.
  * Because each each edge is directed, we say that the directions flow from sources (nodes that only have outward edges)
  * downwards to sinks (nodes that only have inward edges), or from sinks upwards to sources.
  * These terms are used in parameter negotiation, where parameters flow both 
  * upwards and downwards on edges. Note that diplomacy avoids terms like "master/slave",
  * "producer/consumer", though these can be defined by the concrete implementations of diplomatic systems.
  * Such terms imply something about the transactional behavior of agents within a protocol,
  * whereas source/sink and up/down refer only to the structure of the graph and the flow of parameters.
  * - Upward refers to the flow of parameters along edges in the upwards direction.
  * - Downward refers to a flow of parameters along edges in the downwards direction.
  *
  * A useful mnemonic for distinguishing between upward and downward is to imagine
  * a diplomatic graph as a literal network of rivers where water flows in the direction of the edges,
  * and parameters that move in the upstream direction,
  * while downward refers to parameters that move in the downstream direction.
  *
  * ==Acronyms==
  *  
  * Diplomacy has some commonly used acronyms described below:
  *   D[IO], U[IO], E[IO], B[IO] are the types of parameters which will be propagated.
  *   D: Downwards -- parameters passed in the same direction as the edge.
  *   U: Upwards -- parameters passed in the opposite direction as the edge.
  *   E: Edge -- resolved (negotiated) parameters describing conceptual information on graph edges.
  *   B: Bundle should extends from [[chisel3.Data]].

  * }}}
  * 
  * == Handles ==
  *
  * Two Diplomatic nodes can be bound together using the `:=` operator or one of
  * its sibling operators. Binding is asymmetric, and the binding operation will
  * connect the outward of one node to the inward of the other.
  *
  * For example, the expression `a := b` will connect the outward of `b` to the
  * inward of `a`.
  *
  * We would like the `:=` operator to have additional properties that make it
  * intuitive to use:
  *
  * 1. It should be chainable, so that `a := b := c` will have the intuitive effect
  *    of binding c to b and b to a. This requires that the return type of `:=` be the
  *    same as its arguments, because the result of one `:=` operation must be
  *    valid as an argument to other `:=` operations.
  *
  * 2. It should be associative, so that `(a := b) := c` is equivalent to `a := (b := c).`
  *    This means that the order in which the bind operations execute does
  *    not matter, even if split across multiple files.
  *
  * 3. `a := b` should only be allowed if and only if `b` allows outward edges and `a`
  *    allows inward edges. This should be preserved even when chaining
  *    operations, and it should ideally be enforced at compile time.
  *
  * [[NodeHandle]] are a way of satisfying all of these properties. A Handle represents
  * the aggregation of a chain of Nodes, and it preserves information about
  * the connectability of the innermost and the outermost sides of the chain.
  *
  * If `b` supports inward edges, then `a := b` returns a [[NodeHandle]] that supports inward
  * edges that go into `b`. If `a` supports outward edges, then `a := b` returns a
  * [[NodeHandle]] that supports outward edges coming out of `a`.
  *
  * ==Node Terms==
  *
  * These are some conventionally used terms for diplomatic Nodes,
  * which describe different common subtypes that certain protocol implementation might utilize:
  *   - Mixed: implies that the inward and outward NodeImp are not the same (some sort of protocol conversion is occurring between the two implementations).
  *   - Adapter: the number of inward and outward edges must be the same.
  *   - Nexus: the number of nodes connecting from either side are unknown until the graph is constructed and can differ from one another.
  *   - Identity: modifies neither the parameters nor the protocol-specific circuitry for the edges that pass through it.
  *   - Source: cannot have inward edges.
  *   - Sink: cannot have outward edges.
  *   - Junction: the number of inward and outward edges must have a fixed ratio to one another
  *   - Ephemeral: a temporary placeholder used for connectivity operations
